Wiki MONSTER is the simple and sometimes addictive way to learn new stuff.

Its tile sists in the home screen and shows random wikipedia articles. 
If you find the picture or article name interesting it enables you to see the article summary and preview pictures.
For further reading you can open the article in the browser.

If you want more articles just shake the phone and it will show a new one.
Therefore our motto is "Shake-A-Wiki".

This app is the result of a 24 hour Windwos Phone Hackathon organized by Microsoft Slovenia.
